        <h5>Achieving Successes for More Than Thirty Years</h5>
        <p>Mario, a native Texan, grew up in San Antonio and worked as the district attorney for Bexar County for eight years. Straight out of law school, he started taking on crime matters, such as murder and sexual assault charges. Mario turned into an Assistant District Attorney who successfully prosecuted several excessive-profile instances. These included the primary homicide case in Texas to be prosecuted without a frame being observed and the primary case wherein a husband turned into found responsible for raping his wife. For the next thirty years, Mario and his spouse, Christine Del Prado, operated a prosperous defense firm, helping hundreds of clients achieve favorable outcomes, many of which had their charges dropped due to their thorough preparation and willingness to take on the "tough" cases. Mario returned to work as the Chief of the Criminal Trial Division and later the Chief of the Major Crimes Division at the Bexar County District Attorney's office from 2018 to 2022.</p>
