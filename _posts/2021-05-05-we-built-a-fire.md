Assuming you want to build a long burning, hot fire; you start with small, dry, and quick burning kindling, add twigs, small branches, then logs. Using this principal as a guide; the Sarcophagus builders have employed several different on-chain mechanisms to help assure a rational and easily measurable network launch.

### Kindling: 
100,000,000 $SARCO minted

Stablecoin liquidity mining started with 1,000,000 $SARCO

20,000,0000 $SARCO sent to on-chain builders vesting contract


### Twigs:
DAO Launched
	- 79,000,000 $SARCO transferred to DAO.
	- Treasury only controllable by on-chain vote. 

### Branches:
 - UNI-LP Farming
	- Allocation: 2,500,000 $SARCO proportional linear emission over 1 year. 
	- Requires DAO vote to fund contract.

### Logs:
- Embalmer Use Incentives
	- Allocation: 2,500,000 $SARCO
	- Distribution specifics TBD
	- dApp used based, goal of net zero cost of use for testing. Ex. Total user spend including ETH gas and $SARCO should equal rewards. 
	- Requires DAO vote to fund contract.


- Archaeologist Bonding Incentives
	- 17,000,000 $SARCO distributed based on bonded $SARCO in archaeologist servers. Linear emission over the course of one year.
	- Requires DAO vote to fund contract.


The kindling ignites the twigs, the twigs get the branches burning, etc.
