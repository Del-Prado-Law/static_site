As many in the crypto world descend on Miami for the annual lambo moon pilgrimage, the Sarcophagus builders would like to honor the return to Mecca with a simple resurrection game. 

Sarcophagus was built with an option for public disclosure of secrets; so we've decided to use that option to give away 1k $SARCO tokens to the first person/bot/DAO to sweep the account when the sarcophagus is resurrected.

### Process

1. A seed phrase was generated via [https://iancoleman.io/bip39/](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) 

2. 1k $SARCO was sent to the game wallet: [https://etherscan.io/address/0x95fd416374e31885115133Db3c17146Ec6BD67c7](https://etherscan.io/address/0x95fd416374e31885115133Db3c17146Ec6BD67c7)

3. The game wallet seed phrase was placed into a .txt file and a sarcophagus was created containing this file. 

4. The resurrection time (when the recipient's private key will be able to download the file) was set for 6/5/21 at 7pm EST.

5. The private key of the (zero value) recipient wallet is posted publicly: [https://app.sarcophagus.io/#/resurrection?recipientPrivateKey=0x1d42fdeb80ffdfa399ca99a7546b63656df601eb3ea5629fe55fe7d415766abc](https://app.sarcophagus.io/#/resurrection?recipientPrivateKey=0x1d42fdeb80ffdfa399ca99a7546b63656df601eb3ea5629fe55fe7d415766abc)

6. The game is started and the first user to sweep the seed phrase that is inside of the sarcophagus after is has been resurrected keeps the holdings.
