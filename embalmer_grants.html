        <p>In an effort to further decentralize Sarcophagus and to kick-start use, 1000 equal sized grants of SARCO ERC20 tokens will be given away after launch. <span>These 1000 grants will equal 2.5% of the total (fixed) token supply.</span> </p>

        <p>There are no explicit rules for which applications will be chosen. Our goal is to distribute tokens to those applicants that intend to use the tokens for the operation of dead man's switches. Political organizations, will and trust lawyers, crypto-tinkerers are all encouraged to apply. </p>

        <p>If there is any sign of Sybil behavior or coordinated efforts; all suspected accounts will be dropped. This isn't a faucet, it's a grant to a real person or organization that would like to try out the software.</p>
