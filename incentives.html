        <p>To encourage adoption by Archaeologists node operators, we have structured an incentive program that will distribute 15% of the (fixed) token supply over the course of the first ~1 year (2.5m blocks) after launch. This contract will distribute an equal number of tokens per block. Archaeologists will receive incentive rewards in direct proportion to the number SARCO tokens they have bonded while operating the server.</p>
