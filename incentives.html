          <h3>Liquidity Mining</h3>
          <p><a href="https://mining.sarcophagus.io" target="_blank">https://mining.sarcophagus.io</a> stablecoin depositors have $SARCO distributed in proportion to their stake in the pool. 1m tokens are distributed equally over 1 year, started at 00:00 UTC Jan 13th, 2021.</p>

          <h5>Planned:</h5>

          <h3>Embalmer Matching Incentive</h3>

          <p>2m $SARCO allocated for user grants/incentives will be distributed to users who create and manage sarcophagi on the dApp in the first 30 days after mainnet launch. The distribution will be equal to the fees paid to the archaeologist by the embalmer, in the creation and management of sarcophagi. </p>

          <h3>Archaeologist Bonding Incentive</h3>

          <p>15m + 2m $SARCO allocated for archaeologist bonding + grants (a decision was made to combine grants and incentives due to legal / accounting troubles created by grants without consideration). The 17m $SARCO will be distributed per archaeologist in proportion to the amount of $SARCO bonded, over the course of one year, calculated per second. In short: the more an Archaeologist has bonded, for longer, the more they will earn.   </p>

          <h6>Planning:</h6>

          <h3>Uniswap ETH/SARCO Pool Incentive</h3>

          <p>A plan to commit 2.5m $SARCO tokens from the DAO's treasury to incentivize liquidity on Uniswap. Likely in the form of an LP-Token lock linear release mechanism. This would work just like the current Liquidity Mining contract except instead of accepting USDC, DAI, and USDT, it only accepts ETH-SARCO UNI-V2 LP tokens. It would run for one year and would distribute the tokens linearly. </p>
